# Hippo Forge Maven Skin


The Hippo Forge Maven Skin is a Maven site skin based on Apache Maven Fluido Skin which in its turn is based on 
Twitter's bootstrap frontend framework.  

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/forge-maven-skin](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/forge-maven-skin)

It is built by this command:
