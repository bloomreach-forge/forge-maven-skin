# BloomReach Forge Maven Skin


The BloomReach Forge Maven Skin is a Maven site skin based on Apache Maven Fluido Skin which in its turn is based on 
Twitter's bootstrap frontend framework.  

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/forge-maven-skin](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/forge-maven-skin)

It is built by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site
 
The output is in the docs directory; push it and Github Pages will serve the site automatically.
